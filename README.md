## Summary of the project

A healthcare entity requires an information system for the management of the service provided. There will be three profiles that will have access to the system: administrator, physician and patient. The system should allow the administrator to create patients, doctors, offices and schedule appointments. The only personal data that can be updated is the telephone number and home address. The offices have a list of department, list of municipality (according to department) and address. The administrator will be able to configure the doctor's agenda and assign appointments to patients by date and time, taking into account that there are no appointment crossings. Medical appointments may be cancelled if requested by the patient and a justification must be provided. When logging in, the physician will be able to see the appointments assigned for the day and will also be able to list them by month, year and assigned office. The system will allow the physician to enter the patient's diagnosis as appropriate and prescribe one or more medications. The medications available are: acetaminophen, diclofenac, ibuprofen and naproxen. When logging in, the patient will be able to visualize the information reported by the physician in the consultation and will also be able to export in a file (pdf, Excel or Word) such information (diagnosis and prescribed medications).
